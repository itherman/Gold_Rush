# Gold_Rush
Indie Java game with global scoreboard.

This game was created by Ian Etherton in 2020.
It is lightly commented because it was a personal challenge project to design a 2-Dimensional game with a global leaderboard as quickly as possible.
The project uses gradle to stitch together it's local and external data (stored on a Google Sheet).

The Project took me about 3 weeks to complete from start to finish.
I taught myself how to use Gradle, JSON files, the Google Sheets API, and other technologies to complete this project.

Feel free to clone and tweak this project. Let me know if you have any advice how to improve it.
If you'd like to clone and build the project into a jar, you will need to build a gradle project on your prefered IDE and insert my included files.
Then, tweak the credentials to match your own Google Sheet IDs and your access credentials.
To structure the project and setup the credentials to access the google sheet data, I used this guide: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/java

Enjoy!
